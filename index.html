         <h1>Justin's Life and Career</h1>
         <h3>Origin</h3>
         <p>
            On a warm summer night in June of 1997, a kid by the name of Dale Justin Wright was born in a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, to two loving parents. 
            Little did Justin know his journey as a youth would be young, wild and free, moving often and far. Justin would move to Virgina, Germany, North Carolina, and finally
            to Missouri. As Justin got older, only then did he realize that he wished he would've been older when this traveling was occuring as he didn't care to see the sites
            that his parents took him to. That was one thing at that time that Justin did not have in common with his parents, something he did have in common was their competitiveness.
            From a young age, Justin's parents taught him to never quit, never give up, and give everything his all. This caused Justin to become highly competitive.

         <h3>Growing Up</h3>
         <article>
            After landing in Missouri and being able to see family that previously Justin hadn't been able to see much and moving from a military school with many people and friends, moving to small town
            Missouri meant he had less people to make friends with and more people to know what everyone had going on in their lives. Small town Missouri, highly competitive academic, and new kid
            Justin made friends with everyone quick. Throughout his time in highschool, Justin would make 4 lifelong brothers that he would do anything for and go out of his way for if needed.
            In class, Justin became highly interested in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math), but his school really only allowed for studying of two pieces, Science and Math,
            all of which Justin took in when and however he could. Only when taking AP Chemistry in Highschool did Justin find something he loved and could see doing in the future.

         <h3>The Experience</h3>
         <p>
            Justin was accepted to one of the best STEM schools in Missouri, only thanks to his Math and Science skills (Reading and Language Arts did not help). As you could probably guess,
            Justin decided to study Chemistry while in college, little did he know that things would change for him and what he was interested would become disinteresting. Justin had it easy
            early in college. His competitiveness ensured he would get his work done and make sure he understood it for applying later during tests or in class. Only in his third year of classes
            would Justin come to and understanding that chemistry is not what he wanted to do with his life and that technology was more interesting to him. While in college though
            outside of class, Justin would go to join and lead a fraternity on his campus, help throw one of the biggest celebrations in missouri, and find the love of his life...

         <h3>My One<3</h3>
         <article>
            Justin's freshman year of college, he anticipated having fun, meeting new people, and learning alot. In his first class of college though, the chair he sat in would lead him to
            becoming close friends with those around him, including one special girl. From day 1 Justin thought she was cute, but he was shy and didn't know her. They talked and became friends
            only for both to learn that they were studying the same thing. They began hanging out in class and eventually outside of class, going to parties, events, studying, class work, everything
            together, until one day Justin had the courage to take her on a date. Justin still remembers how he originally felt when he first saw her amazing smile, with so much joy, her eyes glimmer
            with the power to do anything, how when he made her laugh it made him feel like he could accomplish anything and made his heart swell with joy thinking of how happy she got out of
            what was probably just some cheesy joke. In 2017 Justin never would've imagined he would've married this amazing woman in Oct. 2022 after graduating and beginning a life together
            much earlier than that.

         <h3>A New World</h3>
         <p>
            Justin graduated from college with a degree in chemistry in Dec. 2019. Justin would go on to move with his tiny family of 4 to Madison, WI where he would begin his journey into the industry
            of technology. Justin was a Quality Assurance Analyst at Epic Systems. Justin was super excited to work at Epic, the campus was huge and the work was fun, along with the people! Justin's job
            was to make sure that what've went out the door and to the user was best for the user. It was what they wanted, and worked smooth and clean enough that the user and easily get the flow of use
            and pick it up quick. Justin's team was small though, and going through a rough time. Justin would help other teams on their work, he would also go on to work on government required software
            as well as country-wide software. Justin was met was quick and deadly deadlines as well as slow and soft deadlines. None the less, Justin stood up to the challenge and took every chance he could
            to have fun and learn all the ins and outs of what he was doing so that the next job he could pick up where he left off on the fun and experiences.

            After his start at Epic, Justin has done a ton and grown a lot. Justin began learning how to code in his free time. Writing fulls applications in Python, working more Software Testing jobs with other
            companies and as a contractor, to experience all forms of the work life! Justin wanted to see and do it all. Now Justin works writing code and learning code with anticipation of one day becoming a software
            developer and writing Webpages to eventually moving up and writing bigger applications, maybe even games that can be enjoyed by all! Justin over time became a big believer of having fun in everything
            that he does. If he is not having fun, is it worth it? Justin has big goals for his future and looks forward to pushing himself everyday to becoming better in all aspects and seeing the world now that he is
            older. He still reminisces of those old days when his parents would take him and his brother to see the world, and now it is in his hands!

            I cannot keep going on this I think I have already spent a little too much time and if I don't physically stop myself I might go on forever which is not necessary. However I would like to take this space,
            as most autobiographies have a space, to say a quick thank you in case some people who might read this in the future. I want to say a big thank you to my <b>Parents</b>, <b>Friends</b>, <b>Wife</b>, and whoever
            else might be reading this! <b>Mom and Dad</b>, thank you guys so much for pushing me to be the best version of myself and always keeping an eye out for me. I have my people now and chose well thanks to how you raised
            me and the qualities you gave me. I am nothing if not an image of you both. <b>To my four friends from highschool</b>, thank you guys for always being you, I know we don't get to talk too much but I miss the old days
            of hanging out in basements, going to the local places to do absolutely nothing but talk, play indian ball down at the park, and all the other fun we had! To <b>Roxanne</b>, thank you so much for being you.
            I love the time we get to spend together and getting to do everything with you. I look forward to having a long and fulfilling life together with our zoo of animals that we will always have, and I look forward to making
            you smile everyday. Last but definitely not least, thank <b><em>YOU</em></b>. Yes, <b><em>YOU</em></b>! You took the time to read this story of mine that I put together myself. This story is sloppy and all over the place
             (there is a reason I am doing technology and not becoming a writer...). You reading this and taking your time to get to this part means that took some serious dedication out of you so thank you. To show my ultimate thanks,
             here are some of my animals!
